Homework #3

﻿Change the scanner you have implemented in HW#1 in order to provide the sequence of the tokens from the given input.

Implement as a predictive, top-down parser, with lookahead=1, and without using a parser generator (such as JavaCC), the following context free grammar (CFG):
S ->  VAR EQ INT SMICOLON  S | E
E ->  VAR EQ Rhs SMICOLON
Rhs -> Rhs PLUS Rhs | Rhs MUL Rhs | Rhs DIV Rhs | Rhs SUB Rhs | LPAR Rhs RPAR| VAR

The parser shall receive as input a string or a text file and shall indicate if the String or text belong to the language represented by this CFG!
Note: skip the symbol: “\n”, “\r”, “ “, “\t”
PS: show your solution here!

Homework #1
Without using a scanner or parser generator, implement a scanner for a language with the following tokens:

LPAR=“(“

RPAR=“)”

MUL=“*”

DIV=“\”

PLUS=“+”

SUB=“-”

INT=[0-9]+

VAR=[A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z]*

EQ=“=“

SMICOLON=“;”
The scanner shall receive as input a string or a file and shall output the sequence of tokens in the input or shall report possible errors!

Note: skip the symbol: “\n”, “\r”, “ “, “\t”
PS: show your solution here!
